You can use it to play sound or write songs, or just watch the sine waves roll endlessly across the screen...

I saw the example and I wanted to make a very pretty version inspired by the ocean, so I started following the tutorial and then quite a bit of my own code, including another page for song creation. Made in vim! (pls do not try to convert me to another editor)

I learned a lot of js and also some css with this website, and sometimes the bugs seemed impossible to fix :,) I got through it eventually and the result is this cute little website <3
